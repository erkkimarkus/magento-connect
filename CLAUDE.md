# CLAUDE.md — Agent Working Guide (Smaily Connect for Magento 2)

If you are a fresh agent picking up this repo: read this first, then `STATUS.md`
(where we are now), then `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (how the module is built),
`docs/RECENGINE_API_CONTRACT.md` (the engine contract you build against), and
`BACKLOG.md`. README gives the 30-second orientation.

## Mission

**Smaily Connect for Magento 2** — a v3 greenfield rewrite of Smaily's Magento
extension. Module `Smaily_Connect`, namespace `Smaily\Connect`, composer package
`smaily/smailyformagento` (name unchanged on purpose — existing installs upgrade
via a plain `composer update`). Target: feature parity with the UNION of the Woo
(`../connect/`) and Shopify (`../shopify-connect/`) Smaily plugins, plus full
Campaign Intelligence support. Aim: become Smaily's official upstream extension.
Magento 2.4.4+ / PHP 8.1–8.4. GPL-3.0. Public product name "Smaily Connect".

Fork: `erkkimarkus/magento-connect` (upstream
`sendsmaily/smaily-magento-extension`). Work happens on branch `v3` (default).

**Public facade:** README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, TESTING and `docs/` are
written as finished-product public documentation. Keep them in that tone —
internal process talk (phases, agents, Linear) lives here and in STATUS.md only.

## Sibling repos (read-only references)

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `../connect/` | The WP/Woo plugin — richest reference (patterns + `docs/LESSONS.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`). Never edit from here. |
| `../shopify-connect/` | The hosted Shopify app — second parity source. |
| `../re/` | The recommendation engine (`smaily-recommendations`). Engine team owns it; source of the contract. |

## Working mode — autonomous with checkpoints

- **Proceed without asking:** implementation, tests, refactors, doc upkeep, and
  reversible technical decisions (record significant ones as you go).
- **Queue for Erkki, don't block:** non-urgent strategic questions and
  human-only tasks — collect them in STATUS.md under "Questions / tasks for
  Erkki"; batch them, don't drip.
- **Stop and ask first:** spending money; anything published externally
  (Marketplace submission, a public release, contact with the Smaily or engine
  team); proposing breaking changes to the engine contract; deleting store
  data; security trade-offs.

## Keeping the docs current — part of every change

Same rule as the sibling repos, same wording on purpose: if your change makes a
doc wrong, your change isn't finished until the doc is fixed in the same
commit. **STATUS.md updates in the same commit that changes reality.** New
operational gotchas go into this file. `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` is a doc too — a
user-visible behaviour change updates it in the same commit.

## Contract discipline

`docs/RECENGINE_API_CONTRACT.md` is a **byte-identical copy** from the engine
repo (`../re/`, `erkkimarkus/smaily-recommendations`) — never hand-edit it.
The `Contract staleness` workflow (daily + push/PR) runs
`bin/check-contract-staleness.sh` and goes red on drift; it needs the repo
secret `ENGINE_CONTRACT_READ_TOKEN` (fine-grained PAT, contents:read on the
engine repo). A sync is NOT code-complete: after any wire-shape change, carry
it through code + test fixtures in the same pass (Woo LESSONS §2.7 — the scar
is real). Datetimes are Z-suffix only; engine URL placeholders are `{email}`
style (str_replace, never sprintf).

## Build / test commands

- Local PHP is 8.5 and this host is missing a few Magento PHP extensions, so:
  `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs`. Magento packages come from
  `mirror.mage-os.org` (repo configured in composer.json).
- **`composer.lock` is committed** (PRO-2473) — CI installs from it, so an
  upstream release cannot turn a green build red on its own. `config.platform.php`
  pins the resolver to 8.1, the oldest PHP the package supports, so the lock
  stays installable on the PHP 8.1 CI job. Refresh it deliberately with
  `composer update --ignore-platform-req='ext-*'`, run the gates, and commit the
  lock in that same pass. The weekly `Lock freshness` workflow files a GitHub
  issue when the lock falls behind.
- Gates — ALL must pass before anything is "done" (CI runs the same):
  - `vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite unit`
  - `vendor/bin/phpcs` (Magento2 standard; errors fail)
  - `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse`
  - `vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.integration.xml.dist` — needs a throwaway
    MySQL (`docker run --rm -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -p 3316:3306
    mysql:8.4` + `SMAILY_IT_DB_PORT=3316`, see TESTING.md); NEVER point
    `SMAILY_IT_DB_*` at the sandbox DB — the suite drops/recreates tables.
- Sandbox: `docker compose up -d` — real Magento 2 at
  `localhost:8080/admin` (admin / smailydev1, 2FA modules disabled). The repo
  is bind-mounted as the module; `vendor/` inside the container is shadowed by
  an anonymous volume (dev deps never leak into the Magento autoloader).
  `bin/magento setup:upgrade && setup:di:compile` in the container is the
  DI-correctness gate (see TESTING.md).
- Release ZIP is built by `.github/workflows/release.yaml` on a published
  GitHub release.

## Language conventions

Repo docs, code, commits, Linear content: English. Conversations with Erkki:
Estonian.

## Linear discipline (Smaily process bridge)

This repository is engineering truth — STATUS/docs stay canonical here. Linear
is the coordination and visibility layer. Full process: Outline → Processes →
"Agent-Driven Development"; compact guide: Linear document "Linear workflow
guide for AI agents" (attached to MGMT-5). Three rules for every agent working
here:

1. **Anchor before work.** A Linear project must exist before substantive work
   starts. This repo's project: [Smaily Connect for Magento 2 — v3
   rewrite](https://linear.app/smaily/project/smaily-connect-for-magento-2-v3-rewrite-34e9fd6ca889),
   team "Product Development", initiatives *Smaily E-Commerce native
   integrations* + *Campaign Intelligence*. Cross-repo asks are filed as issues in the
   sibling projects (Woo: "Smaily Connect for WooCommerce — v3 rewrite",
   Shopify: "Smaily Connect for Shopify — hosted app", engine: "Campaign
   Intelligence — recommendation engine").

2. **One-way doors interrupt.** Before any irreversible or expensive-to-undo
   commitment — persistent data schema, public/integration API contracts (e.g.
   `RECENGINE_API_CONTRACT.md`), releases reaching real users or stores,
   anything touching deliverability/reputation, pricing, or legal/consent —
   halt, file a Linear issue in the project with the evidence and proposed
   action, and wait for Erkki's approval. Reversible work proceeds at full
   speed without asking.

3. **Scribe pass at session end.** Before finishing a working session, distill
   it into Linear: post an honest project status update (onTrack/atRisk/
   offTrack), promote new backlog items to Linear issues, close completed
   issues. Use the `/linear-project` skill if available, otherwise the Linear
   MCP tools directly.

Never duplicate repo documents into Linear — summarize and link. Linear content
is written in English.
