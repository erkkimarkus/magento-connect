## Where we are

**All 6 v3 phases implemented** (~110 files) on branch `v3`, version
**3.0.0-alpha1 — unreleased**. Current truth:

- **2.8.x migration** — sandbox-verified end-to-end: a store on the legacy
  2.8.x extension upgrades via plain `composer update` (same package name) and
  its settings carry over seamlessly.
- **Native admin UX round 1 done** — setup wizard, AJAX config with instant
  feedback, engine automations embedded in the unified automations UI.
- **UI/UX parity phase 1 done (PRO-1270)** — six quick wins from the parity
  analysis: (B1) wizard stepper no longer re-locks completed steps on Back
  and supports forward-clicks through reached steps (session `maxStep`,
  seeded from saved connection/setup-completed state); (B2) all our own
  exception messages that surface in the admin (engine client, Smaily API
  client, provider) are wrapped in `__()`, and the raw passthroughs
  (EngineExchange, Workflows, EnginePing) got translated framing sentences —
  37 new phrases in both CSV packs (invariants held: unique sources, en↔et
  1:1, placeholder parity); (A4) live Feed URL Builder frontend_model on the
  Product RSS Feed config group (category/limit/sort/order → URL +
  copy-to-clipboard with execCommand fallback), linked from the wizard Done
  step; (A5) user-guide links on the wizard Done step, in the post-install
  admin notice (Read Details URL) and as a system.xml section-header comment
  (GitHub URL for now, marked to move to a hosted docs site); (B5) step-2
  sync-field checkboxes are server-rendered instead of jQuery string-built
  HTML; (B6) wizard inline `<style>` extracted to
  `view/adminhtml/web/css/wizard.css` loaded via layout XML. Browser
  re-validated with Playwright in en_US AND et_EE (36+15 checks green:
  stepper behavior, server-rendered labels, builder URL correctness + a live
  200 RSS response for the built URL, clipboard copy, docs links, no module
  JS console errors; before/after screenshot diff of wizard steps 1-2 shows
  only the intended stepper unlock). One pre-existing noise finding: the
  sandbox's bundled `paypal/module-braintree-core` `system.js` throws
  `locations.each is not a function` on the system-config page — third-party,
  not ours.
- **i18n done (PRO-1200)** — `i18n/en_US.csv` (canonical inventory, 242
  phrases) + `i18n/et_EE.csv` (full Estonian pack, Woo-plugin vocabulary);
  covers system.xml, menu/ACL, layout/ui_component XML, phtml `__()` and the
  KO `i18n:` binding. Two previously untranslatable user-facing strings
  wrapped (backfill "already running" notice, wizard unknown-step error).
  Estonian rendering eyeballed in the sandbox (admin wizard/config/grids/menu
  + storefront personalization page); two rendering bugs found and fixed —
  see the browser-validation entry below. The checkout opt-in checkbox is
  now also verified in-browser on the et_EE storefront ("Liitu meie
  uudiskirjaga") — see the engine happy-path entry.
- **Admin UX browser-validated end-to-end** (Playwright vs the sandbox):
  login, menu, wizard all 5 steps (per-step AJAX saves verified in
  `core_config_data`, step gating, non-blocking bad-credential Test
  Connection, backfill start + progress polling, graceful engine-exchange
  failure), config page (Test Connection without save, AJAX workflow
  dropdowns, embedded engine automations block), event/ingest/backfill grids
  with intro blocks, zero module JS console errors, and the et_EE locale
  pass. Two i18n rendering bugs fixed in that pass: (1) grid intro texts
  used layout-XML `translate="true"`, whose evaluation is frozen into the
  locale-agnostic admin layout cache — now translated at render time in
  `intro.phtml`; (2) all `$t()` strings in phtml inline scripts (wizard,
  config assist, engine automations) never reach `js-translation.json`
  (Magento only collects from `.js`/`.html`) so they always rendered
  English — now translated server-side with `__()` + `escapeJs`.
- **Engine happy paths sandbox-verified against the mock engine** (Playwright
  + the shopify-connect `packages/mock-engine` served on the docker bridge):
  wizard step-4 setup exchange (credentials/endpoints map/config stored,
  ping ok, health-check flags clear), embedded engine-automations form
  (catalog §11 loads, PUT §13 all-8-keys upsert lands with
  `configured_via=plugin`, state persists across reload), storefront
  browse tracking end-to-end (product_view / cart_add / checkout_start /
  checkout_complete through the `smaily/relay` proxy to engine browse
  ingest; a campaign-click landing carries `smaily_visitor_token` + rec id
  + ctx; cookie-restriction-ON sender-side anonymous mode verified both
  without and with the consent cookie), live catalog/order ingest + engine
  catalog/customers/orders backfills (queue rows drain to `sent`,
  `tags.product_id` present in catalog payloads), §3b hard-delete →
  `catalog_remove` row → `POST ingest/catalog/remove` (PRO-1231), and
  guest checkout opt-in checkbox rendering + toggle persistence
  (`smaily/checkout/optin` → `smaily_abandoned_cart.newsletter_optin`),
  incl. the et_EE label "Liitu meie uudiskirjaga". Four real bugs found
  and fixed in that pass: (1) `parseSetupInput` forced https and DROPPED
  the port from a pasted setup URL — any engine not on 443 was
  unreachable; now preserves the pasted scheme+port like Woo's
  `parse_setup_url`; (2) the tracker's `consentRequired` flag serialized
  as string `"0"` (truthy in JS), so with cookie restriction OFF the
  identity hint was dropped from every browse event — cast to bool
  (Magento's cookie helper lies about `@return bool`); (3) the
  page-context inline `<script>` was blocked by CSP on checkout (Magento
  enforces CSP there by default), silently losing every `checkout_start`
  event — now rendered via `SecureHtmlRenderer`; (4) all three admin
  grids rendered colliding/duplicated rows because Magento's client-side
  grid storage keys rows by `entity_id` (our PK is `id`, and the queue
  tables carry an unrelated `entity_id` payload column) — fixed with
  `storageConfig.indexField=id` in the three listing XMLs. Not covered by
  the mock: the Smaily campaign-API side (workflow lists, contact sync —
  the sandbox keeps deliberately fake Smaily credentials), so those flows
  still ended in their previously validated failure paths. Sandbox now
  has 2 seeded products (SMAILY-TEE/SMAILY-MUG), 2 guest test orders and
  completed backfill/queue history; engine config was restored to
  disconnected (`browse_tracking=0`) after the pass.
- **Engine contract v1.4.0 adopted + verified** (commit d35bb96, byte-identical
  with the engine repo); **contract staleness CI added** (commit 5bc3767,
  `.github/workflows/contract-staleness.yaml` + `bin/check-contract-staleness.sh`).
- **Integration test suite + CI MySQL done (PRO-1199)** — 35 tests against a
  real MySQL 8.4: 2.8.x settings/schema migration (config mapper on real
  `core_config_data`, password re-encryption, mapping seeding, quote-column
  cleanup), event/ingest queue semantics (idempotent enqueue, claim tokens,
  backoff, parking, stale recovery, janitor retention) and the two flush
  crons with stubbed transports. Harness = standalone `Magento\Framework`
  object graph (`Test/Integration/Support/TestEnvironment.php`), NOT the full
  Magento TestFramework (needs a whole app + search engine — trade-off
  documented in TESTING.md). New CI job `integration` with a MySQL 8.4
  service; unit/static jobs untouched.
- **Product delete → engine §3b done (PRO-1231)** — catalog payloads emit
  `tags.product_id` (parent entity id via a new `ParentProductResolver`;
  `sku` keying untouched per PRO-1267); a
  parent/standalone hard-delete enqueues a `catalog_remove` queue row that
  `FlushIngestQueue` drains through its own non-D6 path to
  `POST /api/v1/ingest/catalog/remove` (endpoints-map key
  `ingest_catalog_remove`, hardcoded-path fallback for pre-v1.4.0
  exchanges; `not_found` = success). Configurable-child delete keeps the
  per-SKU `in_stock=false` soft path; disabled products stay on the
  ProductSaveAfter soft path. Mirrors Woo PRO-1230 (commit 92768d5).
- **Gates green:** 93 unit tests, 38 integration tests, phpcs clean, phpstan
  clean. `setup:upgrade` + `setup:di:compile` re-verified in the docker
  sandbox on the merged tree including PRO-1231.
- **Upstream proposal package drafted (PRO-1198)** —
  `docs/UPSTREAM_PROPOSAL.md`: executive summary, 2.8.x compatibility story,
  staged review plan, Marketplace re-submission as "Smaily Connect",
  pipeline/secret hand-over, honest open items, and the one-way-door decision
  checklist. Awaiting Erkki's review; NOTHING sent or published — the release
  decision and all contact with Smaily are Erkki's alone.

## Open Linear issues

| Issue | What | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| PRO-1198 | Release coordination with Smaily (upstream/Marketplace path) | High — Erkki's decision |
| PRO-1201 | Hyvä theme work package | — |

Closed 2026-07-11: PRO-1199 (integration suite), PRO-1200 (i18n), PRO-1202 /
PRO-1242 (contract v1.4.0), PRO-1231 (product-delete §3b), PRO-1252
(staleness CI). Cross-repo asks filed: PRO-1266 (Shopify contract sync),
PRO-1267 (engine: Magento product-identity contract note).

## Known gaps

- **Real-Smaily-credentials click-through still owed** — the engine side is
  now fully happy-path-verified against the mock engine (see above), but
  the Smaily campaign-API flows (Test Connection success, workflow
  dropdowns populating, contact sync/backfill delivery, opt-in
  confirmation emails) have only been exercised against failure paths;
  one click-through with a real Smaily account (and ideally a real engine
  tenant) is still owed before release.
- **Hyvä untested** (PRO-1201).

## Questions / tasks for Erkki

1. PRO-1198 — release coordination with Smaily (High; blocks any public
   release path). The proposal package is drafted
   (`docs/UPSTREAM_PROPOSAL.md`) and ready for your review; the decision
   checklist at its end lists the one-way doors in recommended order.
