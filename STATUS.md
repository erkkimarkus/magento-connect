## Where we are

**All 6 v3 phases implemented** (~110 files) on branch `v3`, version
**3.0.0-alpha1 — unreleased**. Current truth:

- **UI/UX parity phase 2b done (PRO-1272) — observability depth.**
  (1) Per-row **Details** drill-down in the unified Log: an actions column
  whose custom JS component (`js/grid/columns/log-actions`, overriding
  `isHandlerRequired` — the stock actions column attaches NO click handler
  to plain-href actions) loads `Controller\Adminhtml\Log\Details` into a
  native slide-out modal; the template shows attempt count, honest retry
  state (next retry time / "will NOT retry on its own"), last error,
  payload-as-sent and last response, all through the new
  `Model\Log\PayloadRedactor` (secret-looking keys → `[redacted]`, emails
  masked `e***@g***.com` — last_error is masked too, it routinely quotes
  the contact). Mass retry unaffected. (2) Failed-24h banner above the Log
  (reuses `QueueHealth`, hidden at 0) deep-linking to the grid pre-filtered
  via the core `Magento_Ui/js/grid/url-filter-applier` mechanism
  (`?filters[status]=failed`); the dashboard verdict action + failed tile
  link there too. (3) Backfill cancel + outcome honesty: `JobManager`
  transitions are now race-safe conditional UPDATEs (progress writes never
  touch status, terminal transitions only move active rows, so an admin
  cancel always wins; no schema change — `cancelled` already existed), all
  4 processors stop at the next page boundary via a fresh `isCancelled`
  read, `BackfillState` gained `action=cancel` + `finished_at`/`error` in
  the aggregate, and the shared panels render persisted outcomes on load:
  "Done, X of Y synced" / "Done … — N failed" with a pre-filtered Log link
  (parked/pending-retry rows are NOT counted failed) / "Stopped before an
  error" / "Cancelled" (+ timestamp); cancel = fresh start on restart.
  28 new phrases in both i18n packs (332 total, invariants held; appended —
  a regeneration sweep to drop now-unused phrases is pending). Verified:
  99 unit + 46 integration tests (8 new `JobManagerTest` cases covering the
  cancel races), phpcs/phpstan clean, `setup:upgrade` in the sandbox, and
  Playwright en + et_EE (banner + pre-filtered grid, redacted modal, mass
  retry, live cancel of a pending job + fresh restart + completed-with-
  failures outcome + persistence across reload, wizard step 2 shares the
  same controls, zero module JS console errors). Container
  `setup:di:compile` was SKIPPED this pass: the concurrent phase-2c agent's
  worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` duplicates every class and breaks the
  compiler — runtime DI of all new classes was exercised live instead; run
  di:compile after the worktree is gone. Sandbox restored (seeded rows
  removed, admin locale back to en_US).
- **Multilingual UX done (PRO-1273, phase 2c) — code-complete, browser
  validation PENDING.** Built in the shared-panel idiom (live re-render,
  no save round-trips): (1) routing-mode choice cards on the Connection
  panel (wizard step 1 + Settings > Connection via the shared partial;
  radio-card idiom from the step-2 lawful-basis cards; rendered only when
  `Multilingual\AccountResolver` detects >1 store-view language, else
  locked to `single`; destructive mode-switch guarded by a native
  confirm); (2) mode A UI — per-language credential blocks (per-block
  Test Connection; saved accounts re-test via a new `store_id` fallback
  on the testsmaily endpoint) + default-fallback account picker whose
  account's credentials double as the default scope (new config path
  `smaily_connect/connection/fallback_language`); feeds the existing
  `WizardStepSaver::saveConnect` `accounts[]` handler (extended only
  with `fallback_language` + store-view credential cleanup when leaving
  mode A); (3) mode B/A per-language workflow mapping editor on the
  Automations panel (per trigger: workflow select per language, loaded
  live per account in mode A, + default-fallback radio); writes
  `smaily_automation_mapping` through the new
  `Model\Automation\MappingSaver` (full-desired-state sync: unique-key
  upsert, cleared rows deleted, other websites' rows untouched) behind
  the existing savestep endpoint; (4) **account_key alignment with Woo**
  — `Automation\Router` now returns a `WorkflowMatch` (workflow +
  account_key) and `AutomationHandler` posts through the account the
  mapping row names (fallback rows included; config-default resolutions
  keep following the store view; single/c unchanged); Router lookups now
  also see global rows (`website_id 0` — the scope the editor writes and
  the default-scope migration seeds; website-specific rows win), fixing
  the latent "default-scope migration seeds never matched" gap.
  `Model\Adminhtml\AccountResolver` moved to
  `Model\Multilingual\AccountResolver` (it now serves runtime routing
  too). New tests: `RouterTest` (10 unit — all four modes, fallback,
  account_key, website preference, terminal skips) and
  `MappingSaverTest` (7 integration — upsert idempotency, cleared-row
  deletion, fallback normalization, scope discipline, Router reading
  real SQL back). i18n +32/-1 phrases in both packs (invariants held).
  Docs: USER_GUIDE multilingual section rewritten for the new UI,
  ARCHITECTURE routing + panel sections, CHANGELOG. Verified: 103 unit +
  45 integration tests, phpcs (0 errors) + phpstan clean. **Not yet
  verified in a browser** — the sandbox Playwright pass (mode cards,
  live section swaps, mode-A save path, mapping editor end-to-end)
  happens post-merge by the coordinator.
- **UI/UX parity phase 2a done (PRO-1271) — IA consolidation + full
  dashboard.** The admin is now four pages under Marketing > Smaily
  Connect: **Dashboard** (new landing page: one-sentence health verdict
  reusing the HealthCheck cron's state/query via the extracted
  `Model\Health\QueueHealth`, connection strip, truthful queue-backed
  tiles — catalog tile omitted while the engine is disconnected —
  recent-activity feed, quick links + contextual CTAs), **Setup Wizard**
  (moved to `smaily_connect/wizard`), **Settings** (new tabbed page:
  Connection / Subscribers / Automations incl. the embedded
  engine-automations block / Intelligence incl. engine backfills /
  RSS incl. the URL builder; deep-linkable `?tab=`, per-tab AJAX save via
  the same WizardStepSaver + new `rss` step, live reactivity incl.
  credential-edit → workflow-dropdown refresh) and **Log** (ONE unified
  grid: `Model\ResourceModel\Log\Collection` UNION ALL over both queue
  tables keyed by synthetic `log_id`, source filter, cross-queue mass
  retry). Historical Import and the two old log pages/grids are gone
  (jobs/queues untouched); wizard step content was extracted into shared
  partials (`view/adminhtml/templates/panel/`, shared JS in
  `panel/panels-js.phtml`) that both wizard and Settings render — still
  one config source of truth. Wizard-first gating: setup-incomplete
  installs redirect every Smaily page to the wizard
  (`Model\Adminhtml\SetupGuard`); after a MAJOR version jump (tracked via
  `smaily_connect/internal/last_seen_version`, version read from
  composer.json) a one-time review notice is posted instead of a
  redirect. i18n regenerated (304 phrases, invariants held), docs
  (README/USER_GUIDE/ARCHITECTURE/TESTING/CHANGELOG) updated. Verified:
  93 unit + 38 integration tests, phpcs/phpstan clean, setup:upgrade +
  di:compile in the sandbox, and Playwright en + et_EE (menu = exactly 4
  items, dashboard in degraded/ok states + incomplete-redirect, per-tab
  saves land in `core_config_data` and restore, reactivity without saves,
  unified log filter + 3-row cross-queue mass retry, zero module JS
  console errors); sandbox config/queues restored to pre-test state.
- **2.8.x migration** — sandbox-verified end-to-end: a store on the legacy
  2.8.x extension upgrades via plain `composer update` (same package name) and
  its settings carry over seamlessly.
- **Native admin UX round 1 done** — setup wizard, AJAX config with instant
  feedback, engine automations embedded in the unified automations UI.
- **UI/UX parity phase 1 done (PRO-1270)** — six quick wins from the parity
  analysis: (B1) wizard stepper no longer re-locks completed steps on Back
  and supports forward-clicks through reached steps (session `maxStep`,
  seeded from saved connection/setup-completed state); (B2) all our own
  exception messages that surface in the admin (engine client, Smaily API
  client, provider) are wrapped in `__()`, and the raw passthroughs
  (EngineExchange, Workflows, EnginePing) got translated framing sentences —
  37 new phrases in both CSV packs (invariants held: unique sources, en↔et
  1:1, placeholder parity); (A4) live Feed URL Builder frontend_model on the
  Product RSS Feed config group (category/limit/sort/order → URL +
  copy-to-clipboard with execCommand fallback), linked from the wizard Done
  step; (A5) user-guide links on the wizard Done step, in the post-install
  admin notice (Read Details URL) and as a system.xml section-header comment
  (GitHub URL for now, marked to move to a hosted docs site); (B5) step-2
  sync-field checkboxes are server-rendered instead of jQuery string-built
  HTML; (B6) wizard inline `<style>` extracted to
  `view/adminhtml/web/css/wizard.css` loaded via layout XML. Browser
  re-validated with Playwright in en_US AND et_EE (36+15 checks green:
  stepper behavior, server-rendered labels, builder URL correctness + a live
  200 RSS response for the built URL, clipboard copy, docs links, no module
  JS console errors; before/after screenshot diff of wizard steps 1-2 shows
  only the intended stepper unlock). One pre-existing noise finding: the
  sandbox's bundled `paypal/module-braintree-core` `system.js` throws
  `locations.each is not a function` on the system-config page — third-party,
  not ours.
- **i18n done (PRO-1200)** — `i18n/en_US.csv` (canonical inventory, 242
  phrases) + `i18n/et_EE.csv` (full Estonian pack, Woo-plugin vocabulary);
  covers system.xml, menu/ACL, layout/ui_component XML, phtml `__()` and the
  KO `i18n:` binding. Two previously untranslatable user-facing strings
  wrapped (backfill "already running" notice, wizard unknown-step error).
  Estonian rendering eyeballed in the sandbox (admin wizard/config/grids/menu
  + storefront personalization page); two rendering bugs found and fixed —
  see the browser-validation entry below. The checkout opt-in checkbox is
  now also verified in-browser on the et_EE storefront ("Liitu meie
  uudiskirjaga") — see the engine happy-path entry.
- **Admin UX browser-validated end-to-end** (Playwright vs the sandbox):
  login, menu, wizard all 5 steps (per-step AJAX saves verified in
  `core_config_data`, step gating, non-blocking bad-credential Test
  Connection, backfill start + progress polling, graceful engine-exchange
  failure), config page (Test Connection without save, AJAX workflow
  dropdowns, embedded engine automations block), event/ingest/backfill grids
  with intro blocks, zero module JS console errors, and the et_EE locale
  pass. Two i18n rendering bugs fixed in that pass: (1) grid intro texts
  used layout-XML `translate="true"`, whose evaluation is frozen into the
  locale-agnostic admin layout cache — now translated at render time in
  `intro.phtml`; (2) all `$t()` strings in phtml inline scripts (wizard,
  config assist, engine automations) never reach `js-translation.json`
  (Magento only collects from `.js`/`.html`) so they always rendered
  English — now translated server-side with `__()` + `escapeJs`.
- **Engine happy paths sandbox-verified against the mock engine** (Playwright
  + the shopify-connect `packages/mock-engine` served on the docker bridge):
  wizard step-4 setup exchange (credentials/endpoints map/config stored,
  ping ok, health-check flags clear), embedded engine-automations form
  (catalog §11 loads, PUT §13 all-8-keys upsert lands with
  `configured_via=plugin`, state persists across reload), storefront
  browse tracking end-to-end (product_view / cart_add / checkout_start /
  checkout_complete through the `smaily/relay` proxy to engine browse
  ingest; a campaign-click landing carries `smaily_visitor_token` + rec id
  + ctx; cookie-restriction-ON sender-side anonymous mode verified both
  without and with the consent cookie), live catalog/order ingest + engine
  catalog/customers/orders backfills (queue rows drain to `sent`,
  `tags.product_id` present in catalog payloads), §3b hard-delete →
  `catalog_remove` row → `POST ingest/catalog/remove` (PRO-1231), and
  guest checkout opt-in checkbox rendering + toggle persistence
  (`smaily/checkout/optin` → `smaily_abandoned_cart.newsletter_optin`),
  incl. the et_EE label "Liitu meie uudiskirjaga". Four real bugs found
  and fixed in that pass: (1) `parseSetupInput` forced https and DROPPED
  the port from a pasted setup URL — any engine not on 443 was
  unreachable; now preserves the pasted scheme+port like Woo's
  `parse_setup_url`; (2) the tracker's `consentRequired` flag serialized
  as string `"0"` (truthy in JS), so with cookie restriction OFF the
  identity hint was dropped from every browse event — cast to bool
  (Magento's cookie helper lies about `@return bool`); (3) the
  page-context inline `<script>` was blocked by CSP on checkout (Magento
  enforces CSP there by default), silently losing every `checkout_start`
  event — now rendered via `SecureHtmlRenderer`; (4) all three admin
  grids rendered colliding/duplicated rows because Magento's client-side
  grid storage keys rows by `entity_id` (our PK is `id`, and the queue
  tables carry an unrelated `entity_id` payload column) — fixed with
  `storageConfig.indexField=id` in the three listing XMLs. Not covered by
  the mock: the Smaily campaign-API side (workflow lists, contact sync —
  the sandbox keeps deliberately fake Smaily credentials), so those flows
  still ended in their previously validated failure paths. Sandbox now
  has 2 seeded products (SMAILY-TEE/SMAILY-MUG), 2 guest test orders and
  completed backfill/queue history; engine config was restored to
  disconnected (`browse_tracking=0`) after the pass.
- **Multilingual routing sandbox-verified end-to-end (spike for the Phase 2
  wizard choice-cards)** — all four modes exercised against the sandbox with
  a second store view (`et`, locale et_EE, kept in the sandbox for future
  passes): store-view→language resolution (`Multilingual\LanguageResolver`),
  mode A per-store-view credential selection (`SmailyClientProvider`), and
  the `Automation\Router` matrix (single/c → config defaults; a/b →
  per-language `smaily_automation_mapping` row, then `is_default_fallback`
  row, then config default; unmapped trigger → terminal skip). Live event
  path proven: a real subscriber save on the et store view enqueued
  contact.sync (store_id-scoped credentials, `contact.language=et`) and an
  automation.trigger whose payload routed to the per-language workflow via
  the et account. Verdicts: single/C WORK, A works (credentials via
  store-view config scope; wizard `accounts` save path exists server-side
  but no UI feeds it), B routing works but per-language mapping rows have
  NO admin write path (only the 2.8.x migration seeds `default` fallback
  rows) — the mapping UI is the Phase 2 build. One user-facing defect fixed
  in this pass: the wizard step-3 note falsely claimed per-language routing
  is configured under Configuration > Automations — now points at the real
  Multilingual Mode field (phtml + both i18n packs). The `account_key`
  divergence from Woo found here (mapping rows' account ignored, mode-A
  fallback rows firing through the wrong account) is FIXED in phase 2c —
  see the PRO-1273 entry above.
- **Engine contract v1.4.0 adopted + verified** (commit d35bb96, byte-identical
  with the engine repo); **contract staleness CI added** (commit 5bc3767,
  `.github/workflows/contract-staleness.yaml` + `bin/check-contract-staleness.sh`).
- **Integration test suite + CI MySQL done (PRO-1199)** — 35 tests against a
  real MySQL 8.4: 2.8.x settings/schema migration (config mapper on real
  `core_config_data`, password re-encryption, mapping seeding, quote-column
  cleanup), event/ingest queue semantics (idempotent enqueue, claim tokens,
  backoff, parking, stale recovery, janitor retention) and the two flush
  crons with stubbed transports. Harness = standalone `Magento\Framework`
  object graph (`Test/Integration/Support/TestEnvironment.php`), NOT the full
  Magento TestFramework (needs a whole app + search engine — trade-off
  documented in TESTING.md). New CI job `integration` with a MySQL 8.4
  service; unit/static jobs untouched.
- **Product delete → engine §3b done (PRO-1231)** — catalog payloads emit
  `tags.product_id` (parent entity id via a new `ParentProductResolver`;
  `sku` keying untouched per PRO-1267); a
  parent/standalone hard-delete enqueues a `catalog_remove` queue row that
  `FlushIngestQueue` drains through its own non-D6 path to
  `POST /api/v1/ingest/catalog/remove` (endpoints-map key
  `ingest_catalog_remove`, hardcoded-path fallback for pre-v1.4.0
  exchanges; `not_found` = success). Configurable-child delete keeps the
  per-SKU `in_stock=false` soft path; disabled products stay on the
  ProductSaveAfter soft path. Mirrors Woo PRO-1230 (commit 92768d5).
- **Gates green:** 103 unit tests, 45 integration tests, phpcs clean,
  phpstan clean. `setup:upgrade` + `setup:di:compile` re-verified in the
  docker sandbox on the merged tree including PRO-1231 (the PRO-1273
  worktree changes still owe a di:compile + browser pass post-merge).
- **Hyvä compat skeleton + work package done (PRO-1201)** — full storefront
  audit with file:line evidence, the work plan and the surface × Luma/Hyvä/
  strict-CSP verification matrix live in `docs/HYVA_SUPPORT.md`. Compat
  module `Hyva_SmailyConnect` under `compat/hyva/` (standard Hyvä pattern:
  `hyva_` layout handles, composer `hyva-themes/magento2-smaily-connect`,
  Tailwind registration observer for `hyva:config:generate`): vanilla-JS
  ports of tracker + attribution delivered as static files + inert JSON
  config blocks (no inline executable script — strict-CSP-safe; no
  RequireJS/jQuery; `cart_add` captured from the `checkout/cart/add` form
  submit since Hyvä has no `ajax:addToCart`), plus a Tailwind-styled
  personalization form. Audit verdicts: tracker NEEDS-JS-PORT (done),
  attribution NEEDS-COMPAT-TEMPLATE (done), context blocks / checkout
  opt-in (Luma-fallback checkout) / newsletter / RSS / privacy form
  WORKS-AS-IS, Hyvä Checkout OUT-OF-SCOPE. **Nothing has run on a real
  Hyvä store yet** — `TODO(hyva-store)` markers flag what needs one (esp.
  cart_add vs AJAX-add-to-cart modules, Tailwind class survival). The
  compat dir is inert in the main package (nothing loads its
  registration.php) and excluded from the release ZIP; main-module code
  is untouched except docs.
- **Upstream proposal package drafted (PRO-1198)** —
  `docs/UPSTREAM_PROPOSAL.md`: executive summary, 2.8.x compatibility story,
  staged review plan, Marketplace re-submission as "Smaily Connect",
  pipeline/secret hand-over, honest open items, and the one-way-door decision
  checklist. Awaiting Erkki's review; NOTHING sent or published — the release
  decision and all contact with Smaily are Erkki's alone.

## Open Linear issues

| Issue | What | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| PRO-1198 | Release coordination with Smaily (upstream/Marketplace path) | High — Erkki's decision |
| PRO-1201 | Hyvä theme work package | — |

Closed 2026-07-11: PRO-1199 (integration suite), PRO-1200 (i18n), PRO-1202 /
PRO-1242 (contract v1.4.0), PRO-1231 (product-delete §3b), PRO-1252
(staleness CI). Cross-repo asks filed: PRO-1266 (Shopify contract sync),
PRO-1267 (engine: Magento product-identity contract note).

## Known gaps

- **PRO-1273 multilingual UX browser validation owed** — the phase 2c
  work above is unit/integration/static-verified only; the sandbox
  Playwright pass (mode cards + live swaps, mode-A per-language
  credential save into store-view scopes, mapping editor save/delete
  round-trip, et_EE rendering) plus `setup:di:compile` on the merged
  tree are the coordinator's post-merge job.
- **Real-Smaily-credentials click-through still owed** — the engine side is
  now fully happy-path-verified against the mock engine (see above), but
  the Smaily campaign-API flows (Test Connection success, workflow
  dropdowns populating, contact sync/backfill delivery, opt-in
  confirmation emails) have only been exercised against failure paths;
  one click-through with a real Smaily account (and ideally a real engine
  tenant) is still owed before release.
- **Hyvä unverified on a real store** (PRO-1201) — the compat skeleton and
  plan exist (`docs/HYVA_SUPPORT.md`), but the verification matrix needs a
  Hyvä 1.4+ dev store (free portal key or github source +
  `hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme` + Node 20 Tailwind build).

## Questions / tasks for Erkki

1. PRO-1198 — release coordination with Smaily (High; blocks any public
   release path). The proposal package is drafted
   (`docs/UPSTREAM_PROPOSAL.md`) and ready for your review; the decision
   checklist at its end lists the one-way doors in recommended order.
2. PRO-1201 — Hyvä boundary decisions (see "Open release decisions" in
   `docs/HYVA_SUPPORT.md`): (a) confirm Hyvä Checkout (commercial,
   Magewire) stays out of scope for the first Hyvä release — free Hyvä's
   Luma-fallback checkout is the supported path; (b) compat package
   vendor/name (`hyva-themes/magento2-smaily-connect` needs adoption into
   their tracker vs publishing under `smaily/`); (c) a Hyvä 1.4+ dev store
   is needed to run the verification matrix — free portal license key
   (registration required) or source from github.com/hyva-themes.
