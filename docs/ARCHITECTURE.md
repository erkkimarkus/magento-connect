# Architecture

Developer documentation for the `Smaily_Connect` module (namespace
`Smaily\Connect`). The module is a ground-up v3 rewrite targeting feature
parity with the Smaily Connect plugins for WooCommerce and Shopify; the
three connectors share wire contracts, so cross-platform consistency is a
design constraint, not an accident.

## Layout

Classes live at the **package root** (classic Magento module layout) so the
package works both as a composer dependency (`vendor/smaily/smailyformagento`)
and as a manual `app/code/Smaily/Connect` install — Magento's app/code
autoloader maps `Smaily\Connect\*` to the module root.

```
Api/                service contracts (queue handler interface)
Block/              adminhtml config renderers
Console/Command/    CLI (backfill, engine ping/disconnect, GDPR)
Controller/         frontend: rss, relay, checkout optin, cart restore, privacy
Controller/Adminhtml/  dashboard, wizard, settings, unified log, JSON api
Cron/               queue flushers, abandoned cart, reconcile, backfill tick,
                    janitor, health check
Model/
  Client/           Smaily marketing API client (Guzzle, Basic auth)
  Engine/           Campaign Intelligence: client, settings, ingest queue,
                    payload builders, attribution, browse validation
  Queue/            marketing event queue + per-type handlers
  ContactSync/      lawful-basis mode, payload builder, dispatcher, guard
  AbandonedCart/    quote-scan state, payload, restore tokens
  Automation/       trigger routing (multilingual mapping table + saver)
  Multilingual/     store-view → language, account-key → store-view
  Backfill/         chunked import jobs + processors
  Migration/        2.8.x config mapper (pure, unit-tested)
  Privacy/          profiling consent, data-subject erasure
Observer/           thin event bridges (all logic lives in Model/)
Plugin/             newsletter email suppression, config validation,
                    checkout layout injection
Setup/Patch/        legacy schema cleanup (Schema/), config migration (Data/)
ViewModel/          template data providers
view/               adminhtml pages/panels/grid, frontend JS + templates
i18n/               translation packs (en_US canonical, et_EE)
```

## The two delivery pipelines

Everything outbound flows through one of two **durable queues** — nothing
user-facing ever blocks on an HTTP call, and nothing is lost when an API is
down.

### Marketing events → Smaily (`smaily_event_queue`)

```
Observer / cron ──enqueue──> smaily_event_queue ──cron flush (1 min)──> Smaily API
```

- Event types (`Model/Queue/EventType`): `contact.sync` (batched per store
  view — per-language accounts hit the right credentials),
  `automation.trigger` (delivered one-by-one so a partial failure can never
  re-trigger an automation), `engine.identity_merge`.
- Automation routing (`Model/Automation/Router`, Woo `Multilingual\Router`
  parity): multilingual modes `single`/`c` use the config-default workflow;
  modes `a`/`b` resolve `smaily_automation_mapping` rows — the exact
  (trigger, language) row first, then the trigger's `is_default_fallback`
  row, then the config default; no match anywhere is a terminal skip. Rows
  are looked up for the event's website with legacy global rows
  (`website_id 0` — the 2.8.x migration's default-scope seeding, or a
  pre-Phase-3 save) as the fallback; a website-specific row wins. A matched
  row's `account_key` travels with the workflow (`WorkflowMatch`) and the
  handler posts through THAT account's credentials
  (`Multilingual\AccountResolver` maps the key to a store view; `default`
  = default scope) — so a mode-A fallback row never fires another
  account's workflow ID through the event store view's credentials. The
  admin panels write rows through `Model/Automation/MappingSaver` at the
  target website scope (full-desired-state sync: unique-key upsert,
  cleared rows deleted, other websites' rows untouched).
- Handlers are registered per type in `di.xml`
  (`Model/Queue/HandlerPool`); adding an event type = adding a handler.
- Payloads are built at enqueue time (`ContactSync\SubscriberPayloadBuilder`,
  `ContactSync\SyncDispatcher`) and stored on the row.

### Engine ingest → Campaign Intelligence (`smaily_ingest_queue`)

```
Observer / backfill ──enqueue──> smaily_ingest_queue ──cron flush (1 min)──> engine
       (domain: catalog | customers | orders | browse | catalog_remove)
```

- One wire item per row; the row UUID doubles as the wire `event_id`, so
  engine-side transport dedup makes retries safe.
- `Cron/FlushIngestQueue` sends one batch per domain per run (batch caps
  100/100/50/100 per the contract) and maps the D6 response's
  `errors[].index` back onto individual rows — a 200 is never treated as
  all-or-nothing.
- Every catalog row carries `tags.product_id` — the platform parent product
  id (`Engine\Payload\ParentProductResolver`: a configurable child resolves
  to its parent's entity id, everything else to its own). It keys the
  engine's product-level removal; the `sku` keying is untouched.
- **Product delete** (`Observer/Engine/ProductDeleteBefore`): a
  parent/standalone hard-delete enqueues one `catalog_remove` row; the
  flusher drains those through its own non-D6 path to
  `POST /api/v1/ingest/catalog/remove` (contract §3b — the engine
  tombstones every row matching `tags.product_id`; `not_found` in the
  response is a success, never a retry). A configurable child's deletion
  keeps the per-SKU `in_stock=false` upsert instead — §3b is product-level
  and would tombstone the surviving parent/siblings. A merely
  disabled/hidden product flows through `ProductSaveAfter`'s soft
  tombstone, never §3b.
- **Stock changes (PRO-1951).** `in_stock` is the one catalog field the store
  can move without a product save, and the engine's back-in-stock feature
  reads it, so four hooks feed catalog ingest, all funnelling through
  `Engine\CatalogIngest`:
  `Observer/Engine/ProductSaveAfter` (`catalog_product_save_after`),
  `Observer/Engine/StockItemSaveAfter`
  (`cataloginventory_stock_item_save_after` — Advanced Inventory, the
  `products/{sku}/stockItems` endpoint, the non-MSI order decrement and
  restock) and one thin plugin per MSI seam:
  `Plugin/Engine/SourceItemsSave` on
  `InventoryApi\Api\SourceItemsSaveInterface` and
  `Plugin/Engine/SourceDeduction` on
  `InventorySourceDeductionApi\Model\SourceDeductionServiceInterface`. On a
  default 2.4.x install MSI owns inventory and *placing* an order decrements
  nothing — it writes a reservation, leaving `is_in_stock` untouched; the real
  decrement is the shipment's source deduction, and the credit-memo return to
  stock is its mirror. Both go through `SourceDeductionService`, neither
  through `SourceItemsSave`, hence the two seams. MSI is treated as an
  optional dependency: neither plugin names an MSI type at all, so on an
  install without the Inventory modules they are simply never wired and the
  legacy observer covers everything.
  `CatalogIngest` is also where the engine-connected gate is checked — once,
  for every path including the delete tombstone and the backfill pages — and
  where one product save's duplicate rows are collapsed: it legitimately
  reaches three of the hooks, so a byte-identical row queued twice in a row
  within one request is dropped. This is NOT queue-wide dedupe; two real stock
  moves still queue two rows.
- **`in_stock` source, deliberately the legacy flag (PRO-1951).** It is read
  from `CatalogInventory`'s `is_in_stock`, which MSI keeps synced, not from
  MSI's salable-per-website quantity. A catalog row is keyed on `sku` per
  tenant and one installation is one tenant, so a per-website salable answer
  has nowhere to go until the multi-website tenant work (RFC Phase 4, gated on
  PRO-1459) gives each website its own tenant. `CatalogPayloadBuilder::
  isInStock()` drops the stock registry's per-request memo immediately before
  it reads (MSI mirrors onto the legacy row with direct SQL and so never
  invalidates that memo — otherwise selling out publishes `in_stock: true`).
  It lives at the read, not in a caller, so live hooks, the delete tombstone
  and the backfill/nightly-resync pages are all correct by construction. It
  falls back to **true** if the stock read throws: the fallback is
  deliberate — the engine's recommender excludes out-of-stock products, so
  defaulting to false would silently pull a product out of every campaign over
  a transient read error, which is the worse failure. The nightly reconciler
  corrects a wrong `true` within a day.
- **Periodic catalog reconciler (PRO-1951).** `Cron/CatalogResync` (daily,
  `40 3 * * *` store time — off-peak, just after the queue janitor) starts an
  ordinary catalog backfill job rather than walking the catalog itself, so
  `Cron/BackfillTick` pages it in with the same cursor, time budget and flood
  guard a merchant-started import gets. It never runs disconnected, and the
  one-active-job lock refuses the start while a catalog import is already
  open, so a merchant's own import is never trampled — the sweep skips that
  night instead. It exists for
  the one class of change events cannot see: a CSV / `bin/magento import` run
  writes the catalog tables directly. Latency: event-driven changes ~1–2 min,
  everything else at most ~24 h.
- **Order return signals (contract §5, v1.8.0):** `items[].returned_at` is
  derived from the order's own credit memos on every build
  (`OrderPayloadBuilder`), never from a one-shot event — the engine replaces
  an order's items wholesale on re-ingest, so a later sync that omitted the
  field would erase the return. A line is marked returned only once its FULL
  quantity has been credited (a partly credited quantity stays kept, §5);
  neither reason field is sent, because Magento has no structured return
  taxonomy to map from. A partial credit memo leaves the order state alone,
  so `OrderSaveAfter`'s enqueue gate treats a moved `total_refunded` as a
  change worth re-sending.
- **A refused account stops every send path (PRO-2451).** Contract §2 answers
  `403 tenant_inactive` from every API-key-authenticated endpoint when the
  tenant is deactivated (operator suspension or a GDPR purge — the wire never
  tells the two apart, and the correct reaction is the same). `Engine\Client`
  records it at the single chokepoint every engine call passes through
  (`Engine\Settings::recordRefusal()`, the FIRST refusal's timestamp at
  default scope) and clears it on any authenticated call that answers — the
  health-check ping and the admin's "Check again" are the only calls that
  still go out. `Settings::isSendingAllowed()` (`isConnected() && !isRefused()`)
  is the one gate every SENDING path consults: `Cron/FlushIngestQueue`,
  the engine-bound backfills at `Cron/BackfillTick`'s router,
  `Controller/Relay/Index`, `Queue\Handler\IdentityMergeHandler`,
  `Privacy\ProfilingConsent` and `Cron/CatalogResync`. The two paths that
  loop re-ask only its refusal half once connectedness is proved — per domain
  in the flusher (so one refusal ends the run) and per row in the merge
  handler — because that is the half a mid-run 403 can change.
  `isConnected()` stays the gate for everything that only enqueues, reads or
  displays, so live observers keep queueing and the store's history is intact
  when the account comes back. Rows a refusal met
  mid-batch go back to pending untouched (`IngestQueue::release()` — never
  burned, never failed, attempt counters intact); the janitor prunes them by
  its normal age rule.
- Browse events are the exception: loss-tolerant by design, they are relayed
  synchronously (`Controller/Relay/Index`) and never queued.
- **Catalog price/URL/language scope (PRO-1352/1353):** one Magento
  installation is one engine tenant with one base currency (which every
  catalog row now names, contract §3 `currency`, v1.7.0) — the plugin, not
  the engine, is responsible for always sending one consistent scope's
  price. Both catalog
  ingest paths resolve through the SAME single canonical store
  (`CatalogPayloadBuilder::canonicalStoreId()` — the default store view of
  the default website, the same "default scope" concept as `Engine\Client`'s
  base-URL fallback and `Multilingual\AccountResolver`'s default account),
  never Magento's implicit current-store resolver: the backfill collection
  (`EngineCatalogProcessor::loadPage()`) calls `setStoreId()` with it
  explicitly before `addUrlRewrite()`/`addPriceData()`, and the live path
  (`ProductSaveAfter`/`ProductDeleteBefore`) re-scopes the product to it via
  `ProductRepository::getById($id, false, $canonicalStoreId)` before reading
  price whenever the admin save/delete didn't already resolve that same
  scope. This is a deliberate single-pinned-scope simplification, not a
  per-website fan-out: still one payload per product, so a multi-website
  installation with divergent per-website prices ingests one website's price
  per product. Each `smaily_ingest_queue` catalog row's `store_id` column
  records that canonical ingest scope for audit — not necessarily the store
  the price was read at, see the exception below.
- **The one exception — a product outside the default website
  (PRO-1458):** such a product has no price of its own at the canonical
  scope, so reading it there reports a scope it never sells in. It is priced
  — and its URL built — at the default store view of the first website it IS
  assigned to (lowest website id; `CatalogPayloadBuilder::storeIdForProduct()`).
  The URL is generated from the product loaded at that same store, because
  Magento's URL model reads the rewrite and the base URL off the product's
  OWN store, not off whatever store is emulated around it. A product
  assigned to no website at all keeps the canonical scope and is still
  ingested, never skipped. The row's `currency` still names the canonical
  store's display currency: an install whose second website has a different
  base currency is mislabelled there, and per-website tenants (the
  multi-website RFC's Phase 4, PRO-1762) are the fix for that, not this.

### Queue semantics (both queues)

- **Retry policy:** backoff 60 s / 5 min / 15 min / 1 h / 6 h, max 5
  attempts, then parked as `failed` for manual retry from the admin Log.
  Only failures that can plausibly pass later get those attempts: a
  permanent refusal (4xx other than 429) stops on the first one, parked as
  `failed` with a `permanent_http_<code>` reason. A 429 is parked for the
  `Retry-After` the response asked for (delta-seconds form, capped at 6 h;
  an HTTP-date falls back to the ladder step). `Model\Queue\RetryPolicy`
  for the Smaily queue, `Engine\Client` + `Cron\FlushIngestQueue` for the
  ingest queue.
- **Claiming:** rows are claimed with a per-worker `claim_token`; only rows
  the worker actually won are processed, so concurrent flushes (manual cron,
  multi-node) can never double-send. Rows stuck in `sending` (killed
  worker) are requeued after 15 minutes.
- **Idempotency:** `event_uuid` is unique; callers may pass a deterministic
  UUID to make an enqueue idempotent.
- **Sending again (PRO-2454):** the Log's per-row **Send again** and the
  mass **Retry** both ask `Model\Log\ResendGuard` first — one server-owned
  answer, shaped after Woo's `TransactionalRetryGuard`: a reason code
  (`withdrawn` / `superseded` / `erased`) with the merchant sentence beside
  it, or `''` for a row that is safe. `superseded` is the only one that
  costs a query: for an `automation.trigger` row it asks whether a LATER row
  of the same trigger and the same recipient was delivered (and not itself
  withdrawn), reading each row's trigger out of its payload. Ingest rows are
  idempotent upserts and `contact.sync` repeats a state, so only `erased`
  reaches them. Send again NEVER touches the failed row: it enqueues a NEW
  row with the same event and payload — the failed row is the history, the
  new row is the audit record (Woo DECISIONS, same call) — and the decision
  rides in the new row's payload under `Model\Log\Resend::PAYLOAD_KEY`
  (`_resend: {of, by, at}`, Z-suffixed), which both `decodePayload()`
  methods strip before anything goes on the wire. No column was added for
  it. The mass retry skips what the guard refuses and says how many.
  `withdrawn` is a derived status, not a stored one: the grid's UNION
  computes it from `status = sent` plus the `CANCELLED_RESPONSE` marker, so
  the label AND the status filter read the same value, and the flusher still
  sees the terminal `sent` row it wrote. The grid's error column and the
  Details drawer both show the server's own message through
  `Model\Log\FailureMessage` (RetryPolicy's `permanent_http_<code>:` prefix
  stripped, `PayloadRedactor` applied); the classification stays in the
  drawer.
- **Retention:** sent 30 days, failed 90 days (`Cron/QueueJanitor`). The
  same job sweeps `smaily_abandoned_cart` (PRO-2469) — it owns the schedule
  and the window, while the SQL stays with the table's owner
  (`StateManager::pruneTerminal()` / `pruneOrphans()`): a terminal row
  (`mailed`, `completed`, `expired`, `erased`) older than the 30-day window
  goes, and so does any row whose `quote_id` is no longer in `quote`,
  whatever its status; Magento's own quote cleanup does not cascade onto the
  side table, and a marker with nothing left to mark is dead weight. A live
  quote in a non-terminal status is never touched: that row is what keeps
  `Cron/AbandonedCart` from mailing the same cart twice.
- **Art. 17 erasure** does not wait for retention. `Model\Privacy\LocalEraser`
  (driven by `Console\Command\GdprCommand`) walks BOTH queue tables plus
  `smaily_abandoned_cart` for one address: a row that could still send
  (`pending`, `sending`) is DELETED, a row that is over (`sent`, `failed`)
  is ANONYMISED in place — `entity_id`, `payload`, `sent_payload`,
  `last_response` and `last_error` become one placeholder, keys and
  structure kept, so the merchant keeps the record of the send. Rows are
  matched by DECODING the stored JSON (`Model\Privacy\PayloadAnonymizer`),
  never by searching its raw text: `json_encode` escapes a non-ASCII
  address, which a substring search would miss. The walk reads a narrow
  column list in 1000-row chunks and deletes or anonymises each chunk's
  matches in one transaction before reading the next, so peak memory is one
  chunk; a blob is decoded once and the same decoding answers the match and
  feeds the redaction. The queue tables are `Cron\QueueJanitor::TABLES` —
  the pair the retention sweep prunes — and the cart rows go through
  `Model\AbandonedCart\StateManager`, their only owner. Both `retry()`
  methods skip a row carrying `Model\Privacy\Erasure::PLACEHOLDER` —
  reviving one would put the placeholder on the wire.
  **A cart row is always ANONYMISED, never deleted (PRO-2467)**, whatever
  its status: it is not a message but the marker saying this quote has been
  handled, and the module may not touch the core `quote` table. Delete it
  and a quote that is still active and idle past the cutoff (a merchant who
  ran only `smaily:gdpr erase`, not Magento's own customer deletion) looks
  untracked to the next sweep and is mailed to the address just erased. What
  stays is an email-less tombstone — `email` NULL, status
  `StateManager::STATUS_ERASED` — which `filterAlreadyHandled()` covers like
  any other terminal status, so `Cron\AbandonedCart` neither mails that
  quote nor tracks it afresh, and the status no longer reads `mailed`, so the
  PRO-2453 purchase marker never fires for an erased contact either. The
  tombstone carries no special retention — it leaves on the ordinary 30-day
  cart sweep, like any other terminal row. The export lists cart rows by
  address, so a tombstone is by construction unlisted — there is no address
  left to match, and the row holds nothing else personal. Two writes may
  still reach a tombstone, and neither revives it (PRO-2469): a converting
  quote keeps the row `erased` instead of marking it `completed`, and a
  later checkout opt-in may write the address the shopper types afresh onto
  the row while the status stays `erased`, so no reminder is scheduled.
  Counts and exported rows come back under merchant-facing labels (Queued
  messages, Engine queue, Abandoned carts), which is what the CLI prints.
  `smaily_order_attribution` is deliberately untouched: it holds only
  order id, recommendation id and visitor/session tokens, no contact
  identifier, and the engine-side erasure covers the engine's copy.

## Database tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `smaily_event_queue` | Marketing event queue |
| `smaily_ingest_queue` | Engine ingest queue |
| `smaily_abandoned_cart` | Per-quote send state (`open`/`mailed`/`completed`/`expired`/`erased`) + checkout opt-in flag (the core `quote` table is never altered) |
| `smaily_automation_mapping` | (website, trigger, language, account) → workflow |
| `smaily_backfill_job` | Chunked import jobs (cursor-resumable) |
| `smaily_order_attribution` | Recommendation attribution per order (sales connection) |

All schema is declarative (`etc/db_schema.xml` + whitelist). Both queues are
indexed for the reads their cron drains do (`status`/`domain` + `next_retry_at`,
`created_at` for the janitor); `smaily_event_queue` additionally carries
`(entity_id, event_type, status)` for the per-contact lookup
`EventQueue::cancelPendingAutomation()` runs on every order placed.
`Setup/Patch/Schema/MigrateLegacyQuoteColumns` drops the legacy 2.8.x
artifacts (`quote.reminder_date`, `quote.is_sent`, `smaily_customer_sync`)
because a renamed module's declarative schema cannot.

## Cron jobs (group `smaily_connect`)

The group runs in a separate process (`etc/config.xml`). Host cron should
invoke `bin/magento cron:run` every minute.

| Job | Schedule | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `smaily_flush_event_queue` | every minute | Drain marketing queue |
| `smaily_flush_ingest_queue` | every minute | Drain engine queue (all domains) |
| `smaily_backfill_tick` | every minute | Advance the oldest active import one time-budgeted chunk |
| `smaily_abandoned_cart` | every 5 min | Scan idle quotes, enqueue automations |
| `smaily_contact_reconcile` | every 15 min | Smaily→Magento consent mirror |
| `smaily_health_check` | every 15 min | Engine-down / failure-volume notices |
| `smaily_queue_janitor` | daily 02:20 | Retention pruning (both queues + the abandoned-cart tracker) |
| `smaily_catalog_resync` | daily 03:40 | Full catalog re-sync — the reconciler for stock/price changes no event can see (CSV import) |

## Key flows

### Consent reconcile (consent mode only)

`Cron/ContactReconcile` polls Smaily's action log
(`GET /api/history.php?since_seq_id=…&actions=optin,optout,delete,complaint`,
comma-separated — note the Woo reference's bracket-array form is a latent
bug there, not here) per **resolved account** (a website's own account, plus
one per distinct mode-A per-language account — `Multilingual\AccountResolver`,
deduplicated by resolved credentials) with a durable cursor per account
(`FlagManager`; a website's own account keeps its pre-existing
`smaily_connect_reconcile_seq_w<websiteId>` key, an additional per-language
account gets a `_<accountKey>`-suffixed one, since the action log's `seq_id`
numbering is per Smaily account), and mirrors state onto
`newsletter_subscriber` inside the `ContactSync\ReconcileGuard` so the
subscriber-save observer never echoes the write back to Smaily. Writes use
import mode — no Magento emails.

### Abandoned cart

`Cron/AbandonedCart` scans the native `quote` table (active, has items +
email, idle past cutoff, younger than 24 h), diffs against the
`smaily_abandoned_cart` side table, marks `mailed` **before** dispatching
(a crash costs one reminder, never a duplicate), and enqueues the
automation. The payload's `abandoned_cart_url` is an HMAC-signed
`smaily/cart/restore` link (`AbandonedCart\RestoreTokenManager`, keyed with
the installation crypt key) that restores the exact quote.

**The exit signal (PRO-2453, Woo PRO-1723 parity).** A follow-up series has
to stop when the shopper buys, and a Smaily-only "has ordered since" rule
cannot see a repeat buyer's history the way the store can — so the store
sends the signal. `Observer\OrderPlaced` reads the tracker row BEFORE
`markCompleted()` overwrites it (`StateManager::rowForQuote()`, status
`mailed`) and, when the feature is on for that website,
`ContactSync\SyncDispatcher::dispatchCartPurchase()` does two things:
`EventQueue::cancelPendingAutomation()` withdraws a reminder still sitting
`pending` for that address (terminally, the shape the flusher's own skip
records — `sent`, no `sent_payload`, `EventQueue::CANCELLED_RESPONSE` in
place of an API reply, so the Log keeps the withdrawal), and one plain
`contact.sync` carries `Trigger::ABANDONED_CART_PURCHASED_FIELD`
(`abandoned_cart_purchased_at`) with the order-placed moment. The field is
the merchant's workflow exit condition compared against
`abandoned_cart_automation_at`, so it carries the markers' own
`Trigger::MARKER_STAMP_FORMAT` — the two must sort against each other, and
why that format is what it is is stated there. The row carries the address
and that one field only: the reminder's cart and product fields are never
rewritten. The status IS the scope guard — a quote the extension
never tracked as abandoned (no row, a checkout-optin-only `open` row, or an
erased tombstone) sends nothing, so an ordinary purchase never creates a
contact.

### Attribution (FPC-safe by construction)

Landing capture is client-side (`view/frontend/web/js/attribution.js` —
URL params → first-party cookies), because server-side capture never runs
on FPC-cached pages. At order save (`Observer/Engine/OrderSaveAfter`, where
`entity_id` exists) cookies are stamped into `smaily_order_attribution`;
`OrderPayloadBuilder` forwards them on the order wire
(`smaily_rec_id` / `smaily_visitor_token` / `smaily_rec_ctx` /
`session_id`). The order is the only path these reach the engine on: since
contract v1.7.0 the engine ignores the rec id/context echo on browse
events, so the tracker no longer sends it.

### Browse tracking

`view/frontend/web/js/tracker.js` (RequireJS; core is framework-free
vanilla for a future Hyvä path) reads page context from
`window.smailyPageContext` (set by FPC-cached per-page templates), batches
events for 5 s, and posts to `smaily/relay`. The relay
(`Controller/Relay/Index`) is CSRF-exempt (anonymous beacon), strictly
sanitized (`Engine\BrowseEventValidator` — UUID v4 event ids, event-type
enum, **no client-asserted `customer_email`**, and no `smaily_rec_id` /
`smaily_ctx` hints the engine has ignored since v1.7.0), rate-limited per IP, stamps
`source: plugin_magento` server-side, and forwards so the API key never
reaches the browser. Under Magento cookie restriction mode without cookie
consent the tracker runs in sender-side anonymous mode (contract §6):
events still flow with `session_id` + `event_id` but the
`smaily_visitor_token` identity hint is omitted.

## Admin UI

Four pages under **Marketing > Smaily Connect** (menu.xml): Dashboard,
Initial setup, Settings, Log. Design rules:

- **One source of truth.** The wizard and the Settings page write through
  the same `Model\Adminhtml\WizardStepSaver` into the same system-config
  paths declared in `etc/adminhtml/system.xml` — that section's
  `showInDefault`/`showInWebsite`/`showInStore` are all `"0"` (PRO-1461), so
  it never renders under Stores > Configuration for any admin; the
  declarations stay only for encrypted backend models and CLI
  `config:set`/`config:show`. There is no parallel settings store, and no
  second editing surface.
- **Multi-website (RFC_MULTI_WEBSITE.md).** `Model\Adminhtml\WebsiteContext`
  is the single seam every admin save/prefill path reads to know its target
  website: it resolves a `website` request param (validated against real
  websites) falling back to the installation's default website. On a
  2+-website install, the Settings page renders an explicit website
  selector next to the tab strip and the wizard renders a website-chooser
  step before Connect (own chrome, not Magento's native store-switcher);
  both work by reloading with `?website=<id>` — every AJAX call and the
  page's own prefill (`ViewModel\Adminhtml\WizardData::getBootJson()`)
  already read that same context, so no further plumbing is needed per
  field. Single-website installs never see either control.
  `Model\Adminhtml\SetupGuard`'s completed flag is website-scoped the same
  way, so each website's own onboarding is tracked independently (a new
  website falls back to the installation's existing completed flag via the
  normal website→default scope chain, same as any other field). Campaign
  Intelligence stays installation-wide regardless of the selected website
  (Phase 4 of the RFC, gated on engine-side confirmation).
- **Shared step partials.** The wizard's step content and the Settings
  tabs are the SAME templates (`view/adminhtml/templates/panel/*.phtml`),
  composed by two thin page templates (`wizard/index.phtml`,
  `settings/index.phtml`). Shared behavior (AJAX saves, test connection,
  live workflow dropdowns, backfill progress polling, field reactivity)
  lives once in `panel/panels-js.phtml`, which defines
  `window.smailyPanelsInit` — each page script passes jQuery in and drives
  the stepper (wizard) or the deep-linkable `?tab=` tabs (settings).
  Strings in these inline scripts are translated server-side with `__()`
  (js-translation.json never collects `$t()` from phtml).
- **Multilingual UI is part of the shared panels.** When more than one
  store-view language is detected (`Multilingual\AccountResolver`), the
  Connection panel renders the routing-mode choice cards; mode `a` swaps
  the single credential block for per-language blocks (each with its own
  Test Connection — saved accounts re-test via `store_id` against the
  saved store-view credentials) plus a default-fallback picker whose
  account's credentials double as the default scope. Modes `a`/`b` reveal
  the per-language workflow mapping editor on the Automations panel
  (workflow dropdowns loaded live per account). All sections show/hide
  live on mode change with no save round-trip; leaving mode `a` removes
  the per-store-view credential overrides on save (confirmed in the UI
  first). Single-language installs are locked to `single` and see none of
  this.
- **Dashboard is operational truth.** Every number on
  `dashboard/index.phtml` is a real local queue query
  (`Model\Adminhtml\DashboardStats`); the health verdict reuses the
  HealthCheck cron's failed-rows query (`Model\Health\QueueHealth`) and
  engine-down flag, so the dashboard can never disagree with the admin
  notifications. Unknowable numbers are omitted, not estimated.
- **Unified log.** One grid (`smaily_log_grid`) over BOTH queues:
  `Model\ResourceModel\Log\Collection` builds a `UNION ALL` of the two
  queue tables as a derived table, keyed by the synthetic
  `log_id` (`smaily-<id>` / `intelligence-<id>`) that
  `Controller\Adminhtml\Log\MassRetry` splits to route retries back to the
  right queue. Grid filters/sorting apply to the outer select.
- **Wizard-first gating.** `Model\Adminhtml\SetupGuard`: while
  `smaily_connect/internal/setup_completed` is unset for the current
  `WebsiteContext` target, Dashboard/Settings/Log redirect to the wizard.
  The guard also tracks
  `smaily_connect/internal/last_seen_version` (module version read from
  composer.json via `Model\ModuleVersion`) and posts a one-time admin
  notice after a MAJOR version jump instead of any hard redirect.

## Wire contracts

The authoritative engine contract is
[RECENGINE_API_CONTRACT.md](RECENGINE_API_CONTRACT.md) (v1.8.1, byte-synced
across the Smaily connect repositories). Load-bearing invariants
implemented here:

- Endpoint URLs always come from the stored endpoints map
  (`Engine\Settings`), never concatenated; `{email}` placeholders are
  substituted with `str_replace`.
- Retry: 1/2/4/8/16 s on 429 (honouring `retry_after_seconds` from the
  body) and 5xx; other 4xx never retry (`Engine\Client`).
- Smaily marketing API: HTTP Basic; success envelope `{code:101}`, 203 =
  invalid data, 206 = email not found (`Model\Client\SmailyClient`).
- Engine automations config (§13): every row carries all eight keys;
  validation is all-or-nothing; `per_language` rows saved by other
  platforms survive a Magento save.

## Extension points

- **New queue event type:** implement `Api\Queue\EventHandlerInterface`,
  register in the `HandlerPool` via `di.xml`.
- **New backfill:** implement `Model\Backfill\ProcessorInterface`, register
  under `"{job_type}:{target}"` in `Cron\BackfillTick`'s pool.
- **Payload shape changes:** each payload has exactly one builder class
  (`ContactSync\SubscriberPayloadBuilder`, `AbandonedCart\PayloadBuilder`,
  `Engine\Payload\*`) — the single source of truth used by both live hooks
  and backfills.

## Testing

See [../TESTING.md](../TESTING.md): unit suite + static analysis in CI, a
Docker Magento 2.4.8 sandbox for end-to-end smoke, and a scripted 2.8.x
upgrade-migration verification.
