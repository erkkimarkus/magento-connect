/**
 * Wizard-first gating for the Smaily Connect admin pages:
 * - On a fresh install (setup not completed) every Smaily Connect page
 *   redirects to the setup wizard.
 * - After a MAJOR version upgrade a one-time "review what's new" notice is
 *   posted instead of a hard redirect — the store keeps running on the
 *   migrated settings.
 *
 * The completed flag is website-scoped (RFC_MULTI_WEBSITE.md §2, Phase 2):
 * it reads via the normal website-falls-back-to-default chain, so an
 * existing single-website install is unaffected (its default-scope flag
 * still resolves as "completed" for its one website), while a newly added
 * second website that inherits the same value via fallback is treated as
 * already set up too — consistent with every other field in this module,
 * which the merchant can still give its own distinct settings via the
 * Settings page's website selector or by revisiting the wizard's steps.
