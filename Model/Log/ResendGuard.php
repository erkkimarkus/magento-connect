/**
 * Decides whether one log row may be sent again (PRO-2454) — the single
 * server-owned answer, used by the Log's read model (hide the action and
 * explain why), by the "Send again" route (refuse the request) and by the
 * mass retry (skip the row and report it skipped). Shaped after the Woo
 * plugin's TransactionalRetryGuard: a reason code, with the merchant
 * sentence for it owned right beside it.
 *
 * Three of the refusals are the three ways sending again would be wrong:
 * the reminder was withdrawn on purpose, a later message of the same kind
 * already reached the contact, or the contact's data is gone. Everything
 * else is safe — an engine ingest row is an idempotent upsert, and a
 * contact sync or an identity merge repeats a state, not a message. The
 * fourth is the plain one: only a failed row is sent again at all.
