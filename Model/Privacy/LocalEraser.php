/**
 * The local half of a data-subject request (PRO-2452): the module's OWN
 * tables that can still hold a contact's address after the engine has been
 * asked to forget them — both delivery queues and the abandoned-cart side
 * table. Until this existed, those rows only cleared when the janitor's
 * retention window came round, 30 or 90 days later.
 *
 * Two outcomes, per Erkki's binding decision (2026-09-10), mirroring the
 * WooCommerce sibling's PRO-2383:
 *
 * - **A row that could still send is DELETED.** Not sending is the point of
 *   the erasure, so nothing survives that a flusher could still put on the
 *   wire — `pending` and `sending` alike.
 * - **A row that is over is ANONYMISED in place.** Deleting it would erase
 *   the merchant's own record that they messaged this person. The row keeps
 *   its id, type, status, attempts and timestamps and loses everything that
 *   points at the person: `entity_id` (which for a contact.sync or an
 *   automation row IS the address, and is the Log grid's Entity column),
 *   the queued payload, the payload as sent, the last response and the last
 *   error.
 *
 * Rows are found by decoding, never by searching the raw JSON text — see
 * PayloadAnonymizer. Erasure is idempotent by construction: an anonymised
 * row no longer carries the address it was matched on.
 *
 * Results are keyed by a merchant-facing label, never by a table name: the
 * CLI prints them as they come.
