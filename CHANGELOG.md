# Changelog

### 3.0.0 (unreleased)

Ground-up rewrite as module `Smaily_Connect`, targeting feature parity with the Smaily Connect plugins for WooCommerce and Shopify.

- New module name `Smaily_Connect` (namespace `Smaily\Connect`); composer package name unchanged, settings migrate automatically on `setup:upgrade`.
- Declared PHP (8.1–8.4) and Magento (2.4.4+) requirements in composer.json [[#18](https://github.com/sendsmaily/smaily-magento-extension/issues/18)]
- No more columns on the core `quote` table; legacy `reminder_date`/`is_sent` columns and the unused `smaily_customer_sync` table are cleaned up on upgrade.

### 2.8.1

### 2.8.0

> Notice! This version updates the price values in abandoned cart emails and RSS feed items to include taxes. These prices now match what customers see in the storefront. For B2B (business-to-business) stores, where tax-exclusive pricing may be expected, this behavior might not be suitable.

- RSS-feed uses parent product URL-s for configurable products that are not visible individually.

### 2.0.0

This is a complete rework of the module. The aim was to make the module configurable by website, i.e. abandoned cart, newsletter subscribers synchronization, opt-in form and Smaily API could be configured for each website. Only reasonable solution was to rebuild the module from ground up, because most (if not all) of the functionality was "Default configuration"-centric.
