# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Getting started

Requirements: PHP 8.1–8.4, Composer, Docker (for the sandbox).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendsmaily/smaily-magento-extension.git
cd smaily-magento-extension
composer install    # Magento packages resolve via the Mage-OS mirror
```

If your local PHP is newer than 8.4, add `--ignore-platform-reqs`.

## Development environment

A Docker sandbox with Magento 2.4.8 + sample data and the module mounted at
`app/code/Smaily/Connect`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Storefront: http://localhost:8080/
# Admin:      http://localhost:8080/admin  (admin / smailydev1)

docker exec magento2 bash -c 'cd /var/www/html && bin/magento setup:upgrade'
```

The first start installs Magento and takes several minutes. Reset with
`docker compose down -v`.

## Quality gates

Every pull request must pass CI (the same commands work locally):

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite unit   # unit tests
vendor/bin/phpcs                      # Magento2 coding standard (errors fail)
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse            # level 6, with the Magento extension

# Integration tests need a throwaway MySQL (see TESTING.md for setup):
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.integration.xml.dist
```

Additions to sync payloads or API clients must stay wire-compatible with
the Smaily Connect plugins for WooCommerce and Shopify — see
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#wire-contracts) before touching
a payload builder or client. End-to-end verification steps live in
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

## Pull requests

- Branch from `master`, keep changes focused, include tests for new logic.
- Describe the merchant-visible behavior change in the PR description and
  add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under the unreleased version.
- New settings need `etc/adminhtml/system.xml` + `etc/config.xml` defaults
  and, when replacing a legacy 2.8.x option, a mapping in
  `Model/Migration/LegacyConfigMapper` (with a unit test).

## Releasing

Publishing a GitHub release triggers `.github/workflows/release.yaml`,
which builds and attaches the installable ZIP. The composer package is
`smaily/smailyformagento`; the module version lives in `composer.json` and
`Model/ModuleInfo.php` (keep them in sync).
